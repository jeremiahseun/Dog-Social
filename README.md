# Dog Social App

An Interview Task project.

## Getting Started

This app is built with pure Flutter code and the design was provided by a team.
The is the figma [link](https://www.figma.com/file/bSQMB5hImn2F44fmsr9559/Flutter-Interview-Task?node-id=0%3A1).
##### **This app is built with the [Stacked](www.filledstacks.com) Architecture.**

I made Post Request to this [link](https://hookb.in/pzQ7aK2YoKURPnrrPdZY).

I made the UI pixel perfect and it looks good.

### Recommendations
#### If there is more time:
#####    - I would complete the screens once the UIs are available
#####    - I will make all parts of the UI interactive and responsive as well.
#####    - I will also make more Request to the backend and pull in data gotten.
#####    - I will also write more tests.

#### You can contribute to this project as well.
